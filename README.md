# My First and Simple Git Repository

This is my first attempt to create a Git repository on GitHub.
The goal here is to learn how to create and maintain a repository.
I am interested in (among other things):
_- Creating a branch_
_- Working on the branch and commiting my changes_
_- Merging the branch to main._
